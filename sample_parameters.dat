<---END_OF_PARAMETERS--->


This is a parameter file for the peak comparison code.  
The code will analyze and compare data in the two specified .mca files, 
in the specified range of spectra and channels.  If you change the 
format of the file, prepare for unforeseen consequences.

Valid parameters and their descriptions follow:

EXPERIMENT_DATA
Contains the path to the .mca or .fmca file containing experiment data.

REBIN_FACTOR
An integer value between 1 and 100, specifying a factor to rebin the imported spectra by (default 1).

ADD_BACKGROUND
no: Don't add any background.
const: Add a constant background to the simulated data.
lin: Add a linear background to the simulated data.
quad: Add a quadratic background to the simulated data.

FORCE_NEGATIVE_SLOPE_BACKGROUND
yes: Force the background term to decrease (or stay constant) with increasing energy.
no: Leave background parameters free.

PLOT_OUTPUT
no: Show chisq stats only.
yes: Show a plot of the simulated and experimental data alongside chisq stats.
detailed: Same as 'yes', except plot all simulated datasets and background as well.
detailed_nobg: Same as 'detailed', except don't show background.

VERBOSE
no: Only print the fit chisq value (useful for interfacing with bash scripts).
yes: Print the results of reading in the parameter file and fitting.
debug: Print the above plus debug info.

SAVE_RESULTS
no: Do not save fit results.
yes: Save fit results to a file (fit_poisson.fmca) alongside scaling factors (scalingFactors.dat).

SIMULATED_DATA
Contains the path(s) to the .mca or .fmca file(s) containing simulated data.
Multiple datasets may be specified, each on a separate line.
Two numbers can be specified after the filename, corresponding 
to low and high limits for the relative intensity of that data,
relative to any other datasets specified.  Note: Intensity limits are 
only valid for the second and later files, the first file will be assumed
to have relative intensity 1.

SPECTRUM  START_CHANNEL END_CHANNEL
Contains a list of the spectra to analyze in the experiment and simulated data, 
along with the channel range to analyze.  Multiple spectra may be specified, 
each on a separate line.  Channel numbers are specified assuming a rebin factor of 1.
